## Project Description
During social gatherings, such as "Eurovision" and "E3", we often make additional activities, such as a "Bingo".
This often take time to make, so I made a simple program to automate this process.
The Program features the possibility of making multiple Bingos and change/save its word-pool.
It isn't pretty, but it makes great Bingo Boards to print without using too much ink.<br>

When making a new word, you are able to tag the word's difficulty. You are then able to select how many of each difficulty to print on each Bingo Board, to make the competition as fair as possible for everyone.
